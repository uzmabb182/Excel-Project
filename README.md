# Data Analysis Report:
## Three Conclusions:
1. The parent category verses state bar chart graph shows that  music category has the hightest successful ratio.

1. The state verses date-created line chart implies that he overall trend line for successful projects is higher than failed projects, except for December. 

1. The state percentage verses goal ranges line graph shows the downward negative relationship between the percent rate  and the goal ranges i.e, lower the goal range shows higher number of successful projects

## Some Limitations of the Dataset:

1. One factor predicting success of the project is the use of the funds collected for advertisement and promotional purposes. In this Kickstarter campaign dataset, there is no data available to find out this relationship.

1. Before the project is launched, there should be a survey for collecting data for the demand for it among the target customers. This aspect of data is missing from the datatset.

1. Approval and satistifaction rating data collected after certain period of time is crucial for analysing the success or failure of a project. This is not provided in the dataset and amounts to a limitation.

## Possible Graphs and Tables:

1. Looking at the relationship between the sum of pledges and category, informs us that the most attractive category for  investors is technololgy. 

1. Parent category verses state dataset can be translated into percentage rate and represented in pie chart for visualizing the data.

1. A histogram is way of representing statistcal distribution of data. It also shows relative frequencies of observations that falls into set of bins.

1. Mean, Standard deviation and variance can be visually reepresented by graphs and tables.(Please refer Excel workbook for the homework project)

### Use your data to determine whether mean or the median summarizes the data more meaningfully?
---
<p> Descriptive statistics for summeraizing the data are mean, median and mode. Mean is the average of the numbers in a data set whereas the median is the value that falls exactly in the middle when sorted in ascending order. They are the measure of central tendency of data. Median will be useful for summerizing the data when there are distnct outlier values in the dataset, and they either inflate or deflate summary of the average.Since we do not have outliers in our dataset, we will use mean for summarizing data<p>

### Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaign? Does this make sense. Why or why not?
---


<p> Another set of measure that describe the variability of dataset are variance, standard deviation, and z_scores. Variance is how for values are from the mean(center of data) for the entire dataset. Standard deviation is how far value is on average from the mean. Z_score calculates the variability of each individual data point in dataset.<p>

<p> In a bell plot, center is the mean and approximatly, 68% of the data lies +-1 standard deviation range from the mean in both direction and 95% data lies +-2 standard deviation range from the mean in both direction.<p>

<p> From the descriptive Statistic data analysis, for "backers_count" dataset, we found the following observations:<p>

1. There is a high variance for the majority of 'Backers_count for successful'. And it  makes sense because  when ploted for visual representation, shows a high variance.

1. Percentage of observation falling within +-1 standard deviation from the mean is 97%	for successful state and 95% for failed state (Please refer to the calculations in the Excel worksheet for  descriptive analysis).

1. Mean is greater than median, which makes the data skewed to the right in the histogram.
